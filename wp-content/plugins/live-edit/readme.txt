Edit the title, content and any ACF fields from the front end of your website!

== Description ==

The Live Edit plugin provides a "slide out" panel to edit the title / content and any Advanced Custom Fields on any template file!
Instead of automatically adding an "edit" button to the page or post, this plugin allow you to specify a "region" (div element) which can be edited. This means you can have multiple "edit regions" within the one template file.

A good example of this is to imagine an archive page where multiple posts are shown. This plugin would allow you to quickly edit any visible post's fields!

= Demo =
[vimeo https://vimeo.com/50590785]

= Instructions =
To create an "editable region", use the live_edit() function. This function is placed inside the tag where attributes can be created. eg:
`<div <?php live_edit('field_name1, field_name2, etc'); ?>>
	<p>An edit buton will appear in this div! All HTML inside the div will update refresh after updated!</p>
	<p>Field name 1: <?php the_field('field_name1'); ?></p>
</div>`

= live_edit() =
This function generates the atributes neccessary for the "edit panel" to work. It accepts 2 parameters:

**$fields** - An array or string (comma seperated list) of field names to show in the edit panel. To edit the post title use "post_title", to edit the post content use "post_content", to edit the post excerpt use "post_excerpt", for all ACF fields use "$field_name" - (required)

**$post_id** - A number refering to the post / page to save values against. This can be any $post_id value used in ACF. This includes: "option", "user_$userID", '$taxonomy_$term', 123. Defaults to current $post->ID - (optional)

= if(function_exists("live_edit")) =
It is always good practise to wrap the live_edit() function in a conditional statement. This allows the plugin to be deativated without crashing your website. eg:
`<div class="somthing" <?php if(function_exists("live_edit")){ live_edit('post_title, repeater_field'); }?>>
	<p>..</p>
</div>`
