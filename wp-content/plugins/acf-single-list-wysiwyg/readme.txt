An ACF field that creates a single line WYSIWYG field.

== Description ==

This is useful for things like headlines, where you may want to give authors the opportunity to italicize or bold text in the headline, but don't want to encourage adding a lot of content.

Currently, there are 5 styles that can be added to the field:
* Bold
* Italic
* Underline
* Links
* Strikethrough

You can control which of those elements are available in each field you create.

* ACF 5

1. Copy the `acf-single-line-wysiwyg` folder into your `wp-content/plugins` folder
2. Activate the Single Line WYSIWYG plugin via the plugins admin page
3. Create a new field via ACF and select the Single Line WYSIWYG type
